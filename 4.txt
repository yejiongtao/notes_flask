1. redirect and user sessions	(checkout 4b)
	why Post/Redirect/Get
		when user presses submit with invalid inputs, POST will not be sent
		when pressing submit with valid inputs, POST will be sent
			after this, if refreshing the page, there will be a warning
			because refreshing is actually resending the last request, which is POST
				and in almost all cases, a duplicate form submission is not a desired action
		to avoid this, we redirect the POST request to a GET request
			so, the last request the browser sends will never be a POST
	why user sessions
		the data in the request context becomes invalid once the the request comes to an end
			so the second when responding the second GET request, we cannot access the first POST request's form data
		to fix this, we need user sessions, which can survive across requests
	using them
		from flask import Flask, render_template, session, redirect, url_for

		@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
		def index():
		    form = NameForm()
		    if form.validate_on_submit():
			session['name'] = form.name.data	# session context is like dictionary
			return redirect(url_for('index'))	# use url_for() instead of directly using the path '/', to make it easier to maintain
		    return render_template('index.html', form=form, name=session.get('name'))

2. message flashing	(checkout 4c)
	sometimes you will have to give the user a status update after a request is completed
		for example, to tell him the username and the password do not match
	flash() can be used, which is included in Flask's core featrue
		import and use flash() somewhere in the view function
			flash('Hey! Username and password do not match!')
		give it a place to render in the template
			{% for message in get_flashed_messages() %}		# messages retrieved will not be returned next time
			    <div class="alert alert-warning">			# so flashed messages appear only once and are then discarded
				<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</button>	# the close button
				{{ message }}
			    </div>
			{% endfor %}						

3. NoSQL databases, in contrast of relational database
	usually use collections instead of tables, documents instead of records
		joins become difficult, and usually not supported
	SQL or NoSQL?
		SQL databases store data in an efficient and compact way, and good at preserving consistensy
		NoSQL databases relax some of the consistensy requirements, but sometimes can be better at performance
	For small- to medium-size applications, both SQL and NoSQL databases are perfectly capable

4. Python database framework
	database engines
		Python has packages for most database engines, and Flask puts no restrictions on what to use
	database abstraction layers, such as SQLAlchemy or MongoEngine
		also called object-relational mappers (ORMs) or object-document mappers (ODMs)
			translate from the object domain into the database domain 
		allow you to work at a higher level with regular Python objects instead of database entities
		SQLAlchemy ORM
			supports a list of relational database engines including the popular MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite
			and also provides low level access to the database's native SQL functionality

5. Flask-SQLAlchemy	--a flask extension wrapper of SQLAlchemy
	a database is specified as a URL
		MySQL		mysql://username:password@hostname/database
		Postgres	postgresql://username:password@hostname/database
		SQLite (Unix)	sqlite:////absolute/path/to/database
		SQLite (Windows)sqlite:///c:/absolute/path/to/database
	database configuration
		from flask.ext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

		basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

		app = Flask(__name__)
		app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] =\	# The URL of the application database must be configured as the key SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
		    'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'data.sqlite')
		app.config['SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN'] = True	# this configuration enables automatic commits of database changes at the end of each request

		db = SQLAlchemy(app)				# represents the database and provides access to all the functionality of Flask-SQLAlchemy
	model definition
		class User(db.Model):
		    __tablename__ = 'users'			# defines the name of the table in the database
								# table names are better to be plurals
		    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)	# attributes of the model, defined as instances of the db.Column class
									# Flask-SQLAlchemy requires all models to define a primary key column, which is normally named id
									# and it's managed by Flask-SQLAlchemy
		    username = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True, index=True)

		    def __repr__(self):				# not strictly necessary, just give a readable string representation that can be used for debugging
			return '<User %r>' % self.username
		# a best way to

	database operations

6. SQLAlchemy column types, and the Python type used in the model
	Integer		int			Regular integer, typically 32 bits
	SmallInteger	int			Short-range integer, typically 16 bits
	BigInteger	int or long		Unlimited precision integer
	Float		float			Floating-point number
	Numeric		decimal.Decimal		Fixed-point number
	String		str			Variable-length string
	Text		str			Variable-length string, optimized for large or unbound length
	Unicode		unicode			Variable-length Unicode string
	UnicodeText	unicode			Variable-length Unicode string, optimized for large or unbound length
	Boolean		bool			Boolean value
	Date		datetime.date		Date value
	Time		datetime.time		Time value
	DateTime	datetime.datetime	Date and time value
	Interval	datetime.timedelta	Time interval
	Enum		str			List of string values
	PickleType	Any Python object	Automatic Pickle serialization
	LargeBinary	str			Binary blob
Most common SQLAlchemy column options
	primary_key	If set to True, the column is the table’s primary key.
	unique		If set to True, do not allow duplicate values for this column.
	index		If set to True, create an index for this column, so that queries are more efficient.
	nullable	If set to True, allow empty values for this column. If set to False, the column will not allow null values.
	default		Define a default value for the column.
